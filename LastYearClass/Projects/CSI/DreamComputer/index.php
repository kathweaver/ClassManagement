          <B>Introduction</B></P>

        <P>Your mission is to design your dream computer. Not only are you going 

          to design your dream computer, but you are also going to determine just 

          actually how much it costs. </P>

        <P>Not every one wants or needs the same things out of a computer. One 

          person may want to use a computer primarily for communicating with people 

          on the internet, and for surfing. Someone else might primarily use their 

          computer to download music, share music, and make CDs. Another person 

          may want a computer primarily to do things to make money with it, either 

          word processing and other business tasks, or for programming. Another 

          person may want a computer primarily to play games. You might even want 

          to achieve several different goals with yours. Therefore, not everyone 

          wants and needs the same things in a computer. </P>

        <P>What you need out of a computer will determine not only what processor 

          you want, but what peripheral devices you want. Perhaps you need a different 

          monitor than most, or perhaps you want a scanner, or CD-RW drive. </P>

        <P>Here's your chance to take some time to think about what YOU want and 

          how much it will cost.</P>

        <B>The Task</B> 

        <p></P>

        <P>To successfully complete this project, you will need to turn in the 

          following:</P>

        <UL>
          <LI>a short Word document that explains what you want to do with your 
            computer -- at least 3 paragraphs, introduction, statement, conclusion</LI>
          <LI>an Excel spreadsheet showing the cost of your dream machine, with 
            pricing from at least three different sources. Include the following: 
            <ul>
              <li>in detail what pieces of hardware you want</li>
              <li>in detail what software you want to install, if you build you 
                own machine, don't forget the operating system -- and don't forget 
                you are eligible for academic pricing.</li>
            </ul>
          </LI>
          <LI>a Power Point presentation (at least 3 slides) that displays both 
            what you want to do with the computer, why, and the costs -- you can 
            use this presentation to convince your parents that this is the computer 
            you need for Christmas. The Power Point presentation should be a summary 
            of the Word and Excel documents</LI>

            today, but in the near future. Multiple purposes are encouraged. Write

            one three paragraphs.</LI>

        <p></P>

        <P>There are several reasons I made this the first six weeks project. 

        </P>

        <P>The first is for you to understand exactly what does make up a computer 

          system, and how much they cost.</P>

        <P>The second is for you to think about exactly what you want and need 

          in a computer system.</P>

        <P>The last is to let me know what you think you want to learn about computers. 

          This project tells me more about you, and what you want more than any 

          other assignment I have ever come up with.</P>

          ISD for suggesting this project in our district curriculum.</P>
