          </B><B>Introduction</B></P>

        <P>This lesson was developed from an idea by Charmaine Bently -- Roosevelt 

          High School -- Dallas ISD, which was included in curriculum for Computer 

          Science I.</P>

        <P>This assignment is designed for students to determine what they want 

          in a computer, what it costs, and maybe even help them to convince a 

          parent or other relative to buy. As a teacher, I find that this assignment 

          tells me a lot about a student. Those who really go with the assignment 

          end up telling you a lot about what they currently know about computers 

          and what their interests are. It is assists in developing new assignments.</P>

        <P><A NAME=Learners></A><BR>

          <B>Learners</B></P>

        <P>This lesson is designed as a beginning assignment for Computer Science 

          I (and Pre-AP Computer Science) students. Students should have taken 

          some form of Computer Literacy in Middle School. Additional instruction 

          on hardware components are done during the first weeks of the semester.</P>

        <P><A NAME=Standards></A></P>

        <P><B>Curriculum Standards</B></P>

        <P>This lesson is designed to cover the following Texas <a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/ch126.html#s12622"> 

          TEKS</a>:</P>

        <P>(c) Knowledge and skills.</P>

        <blockquote> 

          <p>(1) Foundations. The student demonstrates knowledge and appropriate 

            use of hardware components, software programs, and their connections. 

            The student is expected to:</p>

          <blockquote> 

            <p>(B) compare, contrast, and appropriately use the various input, 

              processing, output, and primary/secondary storage devices;<br>

            </p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>(4) Information acquisition. The student uses a variety of strategies 

            to acquire information from electronic resources, with appropriate 

            supervision. The student is expected to:</p>

          <blockquote> 

            <p>(A) use local area networks (LAN's) and wide area networks (WAN's), 

              including the Internet and intranet, in research and resource sharing; 

              and</p>

            <p></p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>(11) Communication. The student delivers the product electronically 

            in a variety of media, with appropriate supervision. The student is 

            expected to:</p>

          <blockquote>

            <p>(A) publish information in a variety of ways including, but not 

              limited to, printed copy and monitor displays; and</p>

            <p>(B) publish information in a variety of ways including, but not 

              limited to, software, Internet documents, and video.</p>

            </blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <P><A NAME=Process></A><BR>

          <B>Process</B></P>

        <P><b>The Process</b> </P>

        <p></p>

        <p>Complete your &quot;Dream Computer&quot; Assignment in the following 

          steps:</p>

        <ol>

          <li>Decide exactly what you want to do with your computer. Not just 

            today, but in the near future. Multiple purposes are encouraged. Write 

            this down in a Word Document.</li>

          <li>Determine what CPU, how much hard drive you want, and what peripherals 

            you want. Add this in your word document.</li>

          <li>Create a spreadsheet, listing the above. </li>

          <li>Find three sources, at least one online for your equipment, and 

            price it. Sources could be Microwarehouse, PC Warehouse, Dell, Gateway, 

            Best Buy, Comp USA, or MicroCenter. Or pick your own source.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>This particular lesson is designed for students to work individually 

          and to take a four week period to do it. Some class time is provided, 

          though students are expected to do some research outside of class.</p>

        <P><B>Variations</B></P>

        <P>This could be done as a group assignment, giving each group a particular 

          type of computer to research. However, that doesn't give the teacher 

          much information about their students, a primary objective behind this 

          lesson.</P>

        <P>One way to make this assignment easier to grade, and more structured, 

          is to split the assignment up. Since three documents have been assigned, 

          making the word processing document due at the end of the second six 

          weeks, the spreadsheet at the end of the fourth six weeks, and the presentation 

          due at the end of the six weeks, will make it easier for both students 

          and teacher.</P>

        <P>Of course, you can have the students get up before the class and do 

          a presentation, but I find we have some much material to cover in computer 

          science, we rarely have time for that. Alternatives would be to have 

          the students convert their documents to web pages and post them on the 

          web.</P>

        <P><A NAME=Resources></A><BR>

          <B>Resources Needed</B></P>

        <P>&nbsp;</P>

        <UL>

          <LI>Some basic knowledge of peripherals and what they can be used for.</LI>

          <LI>Access to the web is helpful but not necessary.</LI>

          <LI>Microsoft Office Tools or any other suitable word processing/spreadsheet/presentation 

            software </LI>

        </UL>

        <p><A NAME=Evaluation></A><BR>

          <B>Evaluation</B></p>

        <P>See the evaluation section the student web site. I have decided to 

          have students judge their own work, as an experiment this year. I will, 

          of course, be checking on them, but I am making an assumption that students 

          will do a higher quality of work if they understand exactly what is 

          expected of them.</P>

        <P><A NAME=Conclusion></A><BR>

          <B>Conclusion</B></P>

        <P>I use this lesson as a first project of the year, for two reasons. 

          First to reinforce the importance of hardware knowledge in making buying 

          decisions. Second, this gives me an insight of how and what students 

          are interested in.</P>

        <P><A NAME=Credits></A><BR>

          <B>Credits &amp; References</B></P>

        <P>I would like to thank Charmaine Bently, Roosevelt High School, Dallas, 

          ISD for suggesting this project in our district curriculum.</P>
