    resume and portfolio of their work. Your fourth six weeks project is to create 
    &quot;sampler&quot; website, which can be included in your portfolio. This 
    website will contain a sample of each type of project we do this six weeks. 
    Your website will be posted on a website that anyone can access on the internet 
    if you provide them with the address and a userid and password.</p>
  <p align="left">Requirements = these will be added to as we progress through 
    the six weeks). You will have firm deadlines on many of the projects.</p>
